# Frontend

This React frontend was bootstrapped manually to work with Vite and TailwindCSS.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js (version 18 recommended).
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

The app expects the Flask backend to run on `http://localhost:5000`.
